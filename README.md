# Website-Summarizer

-- Overview --
This project is an AI-powered tool that takes a website URL as input and automatically generates a concise summary of the site’s content. In addition to summarization, the tool analyzes the website’s key themes, relevance, and credibility signals, and produces proper citations for the source. The goal is to transform unstructured web content into clear, reliable, and usable insights.

: Automated Summarization: Extracts and condenses the main ideas of a webpage
: Content Analysis: Identifies key themes and contextual relevance
: Credibility Asessment: Evaluates indicators such as authorship, sourcing, and structure

-- How It Works --
1. User provides a website URL
2. The system scrapes and extracts text from the webpage
3. LLM model processes and summarizes the information
4. Analytical logic evaluates the theme and credibility indicators
5. A formatted summary, analysis, and citation are generated for the user.
